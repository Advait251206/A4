    bio: `I’m a 2nd-year Computer Science Engineering student at Shri Ramdeobaba College of Engineering and Management (Ramdeobaba University). I spend most of my time learning how code works, fixing bugs that appear out of nowhere, and occasionally wondering why it worked yesterday.
I like keeping life balanced—mixing academics with fitness, sports, and a bit of fun. Gym sessions keep me disciplined, tech keeps me curious, and sports (yes, including cricket) keep me sane. When I’m not busy with college work, I’m usually exploring new gadgets, solving coding problems, or getting lost in something interesting for “just five more minutes.”

Hobbies & Interests:
Gym and fitness
Exploring technology and gadgets
Solving coding challenges & puzzles
Sports and casual matches`,
